The work that was done previously to set up the instance is no longer able to be copied since those terminals were closed after the work was done. 
scp -i ~/Desktop/qtm350/qtm350.pem ubuntu@44.203.96.224:~/os.txt ubuntu@44.203.96.224:~/weather_analysis.png 

os.txt                                        100%  400     8.8KB/s   00:00   
This was the code I did to have my file os.txt downloaded, but was just struggling with steps 11 on.
